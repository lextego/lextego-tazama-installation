# Installing the LexTego documentation for Tazama

This is a docusaurus installation that allows you to quickly and easily browse the documentation that we have written to deploy Tazama. It includes the installation of the software required to support Tazama. It is designed to be a quick self host, and with access to the scripts, it should help you deploy the service more quickly. Please note this installation assumes you have access to all the rules, including those that are restricted, to reduce bad actors understanding the full inner workings of Tazama.
