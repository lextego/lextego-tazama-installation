## Private Rule Processors

Now for the final deployment step.

## Background

Individual rule processors are wrapped in a rule executer shell that handles common functions for all rule processors in a common way. While this makes rule processors easier to maintain by abstracting common code into the rule executer and leaving unique code in the rule processor, it does make the deployment process a little more complicated and onerous. In a production setting we would automate the deployment of the rule processors via Helm charts, but for our Docker Compose deployment, the process is a little more manual.

Each rule processor must be wrapped in its own rule-executer. The rule executer source code is centralized in the public `rule-executer` repository, and each rule processor's unique source code is hosted in its own private repository.

## Clone the Rule Executer Repository

First, we have to clone the rule-executer itself. From your source code folder, in a Command Prompt, execute:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="ubuntu"
  values={[
    {label: 'Ubuntu', value: 'ubuntu'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
    {label: 'Mac', value: 'mac'},
  ]}>
    <TabItem value="ubuntu">
        ```bash
        cd ~/code/tazama
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="windows">
        ```
        cd \_GitHub\tazama\
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="mac">
        This is an apple :apple:
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you completed the docker health step, you do not need to clone again

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tazama-lf/rule-executer -b main
```

you should see the following

```bash
Cloning into 'rule-executer'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 1262, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (335/335), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (206/206), done.

Resolving deltas: 100% (687/687), done.
```

By default, the rule executer is configured to build rule 901, the public sample rule processor, but we want it to build each private rule processor instead.

First we need to prepare the rule-executer with the following updates

### Update the .npmrc file

**NOTE: Only perform this step if you do not have a `GH_TOKEN` environment variable in Windows**

Navigate to the rule-executer folder and edit .npmrc from there.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="ubuntu"
  values={[
    {label: 'Ubuntu', value: 'ubuntu'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
    {label: 'Mac', value: 'mac'},
  ]}>
    <TabItem value="ubuntu">
      ```bash
      cd ~/code/tazama/rule-executer
      nano .npmrc
      ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="windows">
        ```
        cd \_GitHub\tazama\rule-executer
        code .
        ```
        Edit the file from VS Code
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="mac">
        This is an apple :apple:
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If your GitHub Personal Access Token had not been added as an Environment Variable, you would need to specify the token in the `.npmrc` file. If you had specified the GH_TOKEN as an environment variable, you can leave the `${GH_TOKEN}` shell variable in place to retrieve it automatically.

To update the `GH_TOKEN`: in VS Code, open the `.npmrc` file in the rule-executer root folder and replace the `${GH_TOKEN}` string with your GitHub Personal Access Token.

### Delete the package-lock.json file

While in the `rule-executer` root folder, delete the `package-lock.json` file from the `rule-executer` root folder:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="ubuntu"
  values={[
    {label: 'Ubuntu', value: 'ubuntu'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
    {label: 'Mac', value: 'mac'},
  ]}>
    <TabItem value="ubuntu">
        ```bash
        cd ~/code/tazama/rule-executer
        rm package-lock.json
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="windows">
        ```bash
        cd \_GitHub\tazama\rule-executer
        del package-lock.json
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="mac">
        This is a banana üçå
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Set Up the Rule Executer for a Specific Rule

Once the rule executer is updated, we can create a rule executer for each of the rule processors. We'll first walk through the process to prepare the rule-executer to deploy a single processor, such as Rule 001, but then we'll show you how you can use a batch file or script to automate the whole process instead of deploying each rule processor one at a time.

To skip ahead to the batch process, click: [batch process alternative](04_tazama.mdx)

### Copy the rule-executer folder

Navigate one folder up to your source code folder and copy the entire `rule-executer` folder to a new folder called `rule-executer-001`:


<Tabs
  defaultValue="ubuntu"
  values={[
    {label: 'Ubuntu', value: 'ubuntu'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
    {label: 'Mac', value: 'mac'},
  ]}>
    <TabItem value="ubuntu">
        ```bash
        cd ..
        cp -r rule-executer rule-executer-001
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="windows">
        cd ..
        xcopy rule-executer rule-executer-001 /E /I /H
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="mac">
        cd ..
        cp -r rule-executer rule-executer-001
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You should now have a new directory call ```rule-executer-001```

### Update the package.json file

Navigate to the new `rule-executer-001` folder and start Nano or VS Code from there.

In VS Code, open the `package.json` file and update the `dependencies.rule` value from `"npm:@frmscoe/rule-901@latest"` to `"npm:@frmscoe/rule-001@latest"`.

We replace

```json
    "rule": "npm:@frmscoe/rule-901@2.0.0",
```

with

```json
    "rule": "npm:@frmscoe/rule-001@latest",
```

### Update the Dockerfile

Now we modify the `Dockerfile` file and update the `RULE_NAME` environment variable value from `"901"` to `"001"`.

### Install software dependencies

You can now execute the following command to install all the software dependencies for the processor:

```bash
nvm use 20
npm install
```

You should see the following output

```bash
npm install
npm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory. Do not use it. Check out lru-cache if you want a good and tested way to coalesce async requests by a key value, which is much more comprehensive and powerful.

### Deploy the processor

And, finally, we can deploy the processor into Docker! Navigate back to the `Full-Stack-Docker-Tazama` folder, and run the command:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="ubuntu"
  values={[
    {label: 'Ubuntu', value: 'ubuntu'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
    {label: 'Mac', value: 'mac'},
  ]}>
    <TabItem value="ubuntu">
        ```
        cd ~/code/tazama/Full-Stack-Docker-Tazama/
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="windows">
        ```
        cd \_GitHub\tazama\Full-Stack-Docker-Tazama\
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="mac">
        This is a banana üçå
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

```
docker compose up -d rule-001
```

You should see the following

```bash
docker compose up -d rule-001

### Repeat steps for the other rule processors as well

The Specific Rule steps above must be performed for each private rule processor to deploy them all.
