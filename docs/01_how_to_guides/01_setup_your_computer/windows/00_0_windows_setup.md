The following portions will help you install and configure a new, or reset pc.

If you are installing a new machine, head over to [Setup a new machine](00_1_windows_setup_new_machine.md), to follow the instructions.

If windows is installed, then we can start installing specific Apps. Head to [setup key apps](00_2_windows_setup_key_apps.md)

## Where next?

Now we have a working machine, we can [Configure WSL2](01_windows_11_wsl2.md) - so you can start using Linux (even if you are not that technical, give it a try - you might surprise yourself.)
