## Install a New version of Windows  

When you turn on a new machine, you will need to have internet access. You will be presented with a number of options, and we have our default settings which we are going to update. Eventually this will be automated for you, but for now we need to save those few extra pennies per month.

### Windows 11 Settings

- Set your language (English UK)
- Set your country/region (United Kingdom)
- Set your keyboard (United Kingdom)
- At this stage there is no need for a second keyboard - so skip
- Connect to your wifi, then choose next
- The machine will check for updates
- Accept the Licence agreement
- Set a machine Name
- When requested to unlock the Microsoft Experience - sign in and use the RobReeveMadrid@live.co.uk account (you will need your 2FA device)
  - If you have an old machine, you can choose to restore from the last machine  
  - or go into Advanced options and choose
    - setup as a new device or
    - another machine if it exists  
- If you have a camera built in, it will want to do Face Sign in - skip for now
- Set a Pin in case
- Don't let apps use your location
- Say Yes to Find my Device
- Only allow "Required only" Data to be sent to Microsoft (not everything needs to go to MS)
- Don't improve Ink and Typing - why do they want to read all our scribblings?
- We don't want tailored experiences
- Don't let Apps use an advertising ID
- Skip customised Experience
- Skip Phone Setup (unless you wish to)
- Don't Use OneDrive - only save files to this PC
- Skip Browser Importing
- Decline MS Office
- Decline Microsoft 365 Basic
- Skip Game Pass (if you want you can come back to this one later ;-)

Your machine will now start its installation
