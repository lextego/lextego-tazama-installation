## Pre - requisites

it is assumed you have downloaded the latest [Ubuntu ISO image](https://ubuntu.com/download/server) and used [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) to deploy it to your USB stick  

We are documenting for 24.04.1 LTS (we normally update to the latest LTS once the version is at least 9 months old)

## Install Server

### Featured Server Snaps

1. Microk8s  
1. AWS-CLI
1. Done

### Complete installation

Once installation is complete

1. Reboot Now
2. Remove installation Media
3. press ```ENTER```

## Install Default Services

Once you have logged in for the first time, you can now SSH in to the box if you wish, or you can continue locally

### Install Nano, so we can make life easier

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install nano
```

### Working on a Laptop

Nothing worse than the laptop screen glaring away all the time - when you are doing nothing...  

This section needs to be reviewed, as it caused the terminal to freeze too

```bash
setterm --blank 1
```

After executing the command the screen will turn off automatically every minute (if idle).

And even better, if you want the command to be executed automatically at boot, you can add it to the GRUB commandline, to do so we have to edit the next file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```

Once there, just add ```consoleblank=60``` to ```GRUB_CMDLINE_DEFAULT```, it should look like this:

```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet consoleblank=60"
```

- Write out the file ```ctrl``` + ```o```
- Accept the name
- close the file ```ctrl``` + ```x```

close the file and save it, after that just run ```sudo update-grub``` and voila, every time you boot the screen will turn off automatically every 60 sec. (again, if idle).
