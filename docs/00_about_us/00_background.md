## Introduction

Hello and welcome! If you are reading this, we hope it's because you'd like to know a bit more about LexTego and some of our history.

## Overview of our Project

One of our biggest achievements to date is Tazama. Tazama is an open source software (OSS) real-time <<-insert your use case here->> monitoring solution. In its initial incarnation Tazama is focused on transaction monitoring for the detection of Fraud and Money Laundering behaviour. We built an open source product as many companies struggle to implement controls in the early stage of building a Financial Services company, and by the time they started to realise the importance, the budget had gone to implementing features, and the "Cost Centre" that is compliance only becomes a priority when the product is ready to go live - and the regulators need to approve the launch. This invariably left any implementer facing a very expensive 3rd party solution or risk launching without appropriate controls.

We were fortunate enough to share these challenges with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), along with Greg McCormick. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation wanted to build a service that can be used to promote trust in digital payments systems and encourage previously under-serviced communities to participate in digital payments ecosystems without worrying about the safety of their money. The product was envisaged by the [Level One Project](https://www.leveloneproject.org). In August 2020, during COVID lockdown, the project was approved and a few months later LexTego was born to help define the product and architecture and 

While Tazama has strong applications in the financial services industry, it can also be used in other ways. The system could ingest any kind of data in real-time and model behavior over time based on rules and scenarios specific to that data. Tazama could have applications in Healthcare Monitoring, Cybersecurity, Supply Chain Management, Smart City Applications, Retail and Customer Behavior Analysis, Transportation and Logistics, Environmental Monitoring, Telecommunications, IoT Devices and Smart Environments.

We were privileged, and excited, that the product joined The Linux Foundation at the start of 2024 as one of their many excellent Projects. You can read more about the [launch here](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-launches-tazama-for-real-time-fraud-management)
